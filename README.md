### Governed Reward Shaping for MARLS

This repository contains environments, governance wrappers and implemented models for different
MARL system architectures. And, the corresponding experiments and jupyter notebooks for result replication across
different sparse environment practical use-cases.

### Developer Execution Instructions

For debugging the project and parallely interacting with the codebase follow below stated two steps:

* First, open the project in your IDE and set the project `PYTHONPATH` 
with command `export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$/.`

* Second, simply run the command `python **_**/**_**.py` to test specific module
of your choice from the project while your `pwd` is `{some-base-path}/gov-rs-marls/`
